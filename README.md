# From-Scratch Neural Network Regressor

**Python (NumPy & PyTorch) | Group Coursework**

This project consists of two main parts:
1. A **from-scratch neural network library** implemented in NumPy (no autograd)
2. A **regression model** predicting California housing prices using either the custom library or PyTorch

This was a **group project** for Imperial College Londonâ€™s COMP70050 course, showcasing both low-level deep learning understanding and practical regression performance.
